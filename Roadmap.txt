Below is a copy/paste “build brief” prompt you can give to a designer/developer (or to an AI website builder) to rebuild PKF Chartouni as a modern static site (Netlify-hosted) while preserving all existing content/data and aligning the look/feel to PKF Global’s website patterns (hero storytelling, clean sections, strong typography, services + publications emphasis).

EXTENSIVE BUILD PROMPT — “PKF Chartouni (Lebanon) Modern Static Website on Netlify”
1) Your role + outcome
You are a senior product designer + frontend engineer. Build a modern, fast, accessible marketing website for PKF Chartouni (Lebanon) with all the content currently on the site preserved and migrated (pages, copy, services, publications list, PDFs, team bios, legal disclaimer, careers info, contact form fields). 
pkflb.com
+6
pkflb.com

pkflb.com

The new site must be:

Static (no CMS required for launch)

Hosted on Netlify

Only one functional form is required (the Contact form); everything else is static content.

2) Design direction (match PKF Global vibe)
Design should feel like a modern global professional services brand:

Clean grid, lots of whitespace, modern typography, strong headings

Hero sections similar in structure to PKF Global: feature-led hero + clear CTA, then “services & solutions”, then publications highlights, then “why choose us” and contact CTA. 
pkf.com
+2
pkf.com
+2

Use a premium, confident tone. The global site messaging emphasizes community/growth and global reach; keep the local firm’s credibility while modernizing layout. 
pkf.com
+2
pkf.com
+2

Visually: subtle brand motifs are OK (e.g., circular/radial accent patterns reminiscent of PKF brand artwork). Don’t clutter; keep it corporate-modern.

3) Constraints + tech requirements
Hosting / build

Deploy on Netlify.

Provide:

/public (or equivalent) assets folder

netlify.toml (or _redirects) for clean redirects from old .php URLs

SEO essentials (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)

Use a modern static framework or clean HTML:

Recommended: Astro or Eleventy (fast static builds), or Next.js static export

Styling: Tailwind or modern CSS (your choice)

Keep JS minimal (nav menu, form UX).

Form

Implement the Contact Us form using Netlify Forms (no backend).

Include spam protection (honeypot; optionally Netlify reCAPTCHA).

After submit: success page and/or inline success message.

4) Information architecture (site map)
Create this structure (clean URLs; no .php in final URLs):

Top-level navigation

Home

About

Services (overview + subpages)

Publications

Careers

Contact

Footer

Team (or “Our Team” under About)

Legal

PKF Global / PKF Firms link (external)

Address + key contacts

Migrate all text and downloads from the existing site. Maintain meaning; light editing only for grammar/typos if needed.

Home page — required sections/content
Build a modern homepage using this content and structure:

Hero (above the fold)

Headline: “PKF Chartouni” + “Accountants & business advisers” 
pkflb.com
webp
pkf-jpg.webp
113.8KB
Primary CTA: “Get in touch”

Secondary CTA: “Explore services”

Use 1–2 short supportive lines highlighting global + local capability (reference existing copy and/or concise paraphrase).

About PKF Chartouni (homepage teaser)
Include the firm story and positioning (keep the substance):

About → Our Philosophies
Create a clean page with:

“Making a difference”, “Personalization”, “Innovation” sections (use current copy).

Preserves the full careers pitch and the list of “Our people are our strength…” bullets

Service cards: consistent icons/labels

Publications cards: thumbnail + title + excerpt + CTA

Team cards: name, title, expandable bio or dedicated detail layout

pkflb.com

7) SEO + performance + accessibility (non-negotiable)
Lighthouse targets: 90+ Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO

Semantic headings, alt text, keyboard nav, focus states, contrast-compliant

OpenGraph + Twitter metadata per page

Structured data: Organization + LocalBusiness/ProfessionalService

Canonicals, sitemap.xml, robots.txt

8) Redirects (preserve existing links + SEO)
Create 301 redirects from old URLs to new clean URLs.

Put redirects in _redirects or netlify.toml. Example mapping (expand to all pages):

/homepage.php            /                301
/about.php               /about/           301
/team.php                /about/team/      301

/careers.php             /careers/         301
/contact-us.php          /contact/         301
9) Deliverables
Provide:

Full static site source code

Netlify-ready config + build instructions

All PDFs/images migrated into an organized assets folder (or keep existing paths with redirects)

A short content/config file (JSON/YAML/MD) so text is easy to update later

10) Tone of voice
Keep: confident, partner-led, international-quality.
Avoid: overly salesy language.
Maintain the firm’s established credibility and Lebanese presence while aligning with a modern global layout.

If you want, I can also generate a page-by-page wireframe outline (section order + suggested UI blocks) using only the content you currently have, so your designer can jump straight into Figma.

You said:
ok
ChatGPT said:
Cool — two helpful next steps I can do right now. Pick one:

Page-by-page wireframe outline (Home/About/Services/etc.) with exact section order + what content goes where (using only your existing copy).

A structured content model (JSON/YAML) for a static build (services, team, publications, downloads, nav), so your dev can implement quickly in Astro/Eleventy.

Tell me 1 or 2, and whether you prefer Astro or plain HTML + Tailwind (either is Netlify-friendly).

You said:
plain HTML + Tailwind

Thought for 14s
Great — here’s a ready-to-build blueprint for a plain HTML + Tailwind static site on Netlify, including:

Recommended folder structure

Reusable component patterns (header, hero, cards, team, publications, CTA band, footer)

Page-by-page wireframe + section order

Netlify Forms contact form markup

      menu.classList.toggle('hidden');
      btn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', String(!isOpen));
    });

</header>
6) Netlify contact form (the only “dynamic” part)
Put this in /contact/index.html:

<form name="contact"
      method="POST"
      action="/contact/thank-you.html"
      data-netlify="true"
      data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field"

7) Redirects for old .php URLs (Netlify _redirects)
Create a file named _redirects at the project root:

/homepage.php            /                         301
/about.php               /about/                    301
/our-philosophies.php     /about/philosophies.html  301
/our-team.php             /about/team.html          301
/legal.php               /about/legal.html          301

/contact-us.php          /contact/                  301
(Extend this list to every legacy URL you have.)

8) Optional: content model (JSON) to keep “all data” organized
Even if you paste into HTML manually, keeping a single source-of-truth file prevents missing content.

9) What I recommend you do next (fastest path)
If you paste me your current pages’ text (or let me scrape/extract it if you want), I can produce:
All final HTML files for every page in that structure, already styled in Tailwind, with consistent components, and your migrated content placed correctly.

If you want that, tell me: do you want a light theme (white/gray) or dark accents (charcoal) as the dominant style?

Perfect — here’s a light-theme UI spec + copy/paste Tailwind component set you can use to build every page consistently (plain HTML, Netlify-hosted). Everything is designed to feel global, clean, premium: lots of whitespace, crisp typography, subtle borders, gentle shadows, and strong CTAs.

Light theme style system (use Tailwind defaults)
Color + surfaces
Background: bg-white

Section alt background: bg-gray-50

Cards: bg-white border border-gray-200 shadow-sm

Text primary: text-gray-900

Text secondary: text-gray-600

Borders/dividers: border-gray-200

CTA button: bg-gray-900 text-white hover:bg-gray-800

Links: text-gray-900 hover:underline

Focus ring: focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-900 focus:ring-offset-2

Typography (simple, modern)
Headings: font-semibold tracking-tight

Body: leading-relaxed

Use a clean sans font (optional): Inter / Source Sans 3 (via <link> in <head>)

Layout rhythm
Page container: max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4

Section padding: py-14 md:py-20

Card padding: p-6 md:p-7

Radius: rounded-2xl (premium feel)

Shadows: shadow-sm (subtle)

“Base shell” you’ll reuse on every page
1) <head> (light theme defaults + SEO)
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <title>PKF Chartouni | Accountants & business advisers</title>
  <meta name="description" content="PKF Chartouni provides assurance, tax, advisory and corporate finance services with local expertise and global reach." />

  <!-- Optional font -->
